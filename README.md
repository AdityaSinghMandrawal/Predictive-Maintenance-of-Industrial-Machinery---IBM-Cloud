# Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery 🚧

This repository contains the capstone project I completed during the **IBM SkillsBuild 4-week Internship** in collaboration with **Edunet Foundation** and **AICTE**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
In today’s industrial environment, unplanned equipment failures lead to costly downtime and inefficiencies. Traditional maintenance methods either react too late or over-maintain machines. This project aims to shift the industry toward **predictive maintenance** by using real-time sensor data and machine learning to forecast failures before they occur.

## 🛠️ Solution Overview
- Built a predictive ML model using sensor data (torque, speed, tool wear, temperature, etc.)
- Achieved 99.5% accuracy using Snap Random Forest Classifier
- Deployed the model using **IBM Watson Studio on IBM Cloud Lite**
- Created an interface to simulate real-time monitoring and predictions

## 📂 Dataset
[Kaggle: Predictive Maintenance Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification)

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies
- IBM Cloud Lite & Watsonx.ai Studio
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Snap Random Forest Classifier

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Simulated via Kaggle dataset
2. **Preprocessing** – Cleaning, feature engineering
3. **Model Training** – Snap Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning
4. **Deployment** – IBM Cloud with evaluation and alerts

## 🎯 Results
- Over **99.5% accuracy** in classifying failure types
- Real-time predictions enabled proactive maintenance decisions
- Graphical evaluations: Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall, ROC curve

## 🌐 Future Scope
- Integrate vibration and acoustic data for richer insights
- Implement real-time edge computing
- Explore Deep Learning with LSTM/CNN
- Containerize the model for scalable deployment via IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS)
