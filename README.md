# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Industrial-Machinery---IBM-Cloud
A machine learning project developed during the IBM SkillsBuild Internship, focused on building a predictive maintenance system for industrial machinery using sensor data. The model predicts potential failures like tool wear, power failures, and heat dissipation issues using IBM Cloud and Watson Studio.
